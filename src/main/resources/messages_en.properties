about = \
<p><strong>EuregJUG Maas-Rhine</strong> is a cross-border, english-language \
Java User Group. Java User Groups (JUGs) are volunteer, non-commercial \
organizations of enthusiasts that strive to distribute Java-related knowledge \
in their neighbourhood. They provide a meeting place for Java users to get \
information, share resources and solutions, increase networking and expand \
Java Technology expertise. The Euregio Maas-Rhine is lacking such a group, \
despite its potential of nearly 4m inhabitants and an infrastructure of \
computer science related universities and companies. We want to fill that gap.</p>\
<p><strong>"EuregJUG"</strong> is a portmanteau of <strong>"Euregio"</strong> \
and <strong>"JUG"</strong> (Java User Group) emphasizing the geographical and \
technical scope of the group.</p>\
<p>The EuregJUG was founded in  Spring 2015 by <a href="https://twitter.com/spfeiffr">\
Dr. Stefan Pfeiffer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rotnroll666">Michael Simons</a>.</p>
